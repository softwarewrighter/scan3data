PROJECT NOTES FOR scan2data
===========================

RUST-FIRST PHILOSOPHY
---------------------
This is a Rust-focused project. ALL business logic, processing, and presentation
should be in Rust. Avoid JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.

- Frontend: Yew (Rust compiled to WASM), not React/Vue/Svelte
- Backend: Axum (Rust), not Express/FastAPI
- Image processing: image/imageproc crates, not PIL/OpenCV-Python
- OCR integration: leptess (Rust bindings), not calling pytesseract
- CLI: clap (Rust), not argparse/click

The only acceptable use of non-Rust code:
- Calling external binaries via Command::new() when no Rust alternative exists
- Minimal HTML/CSS for the web UI structure (unavoidable)

DUPLICATE DETECTION REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------
The ./test-data directory contains many duplicate scans with different filenames.
During the "ingest" phase, duplicates MUST be detected and combined.

Requirements:
1. Compute hash (SHA-256) of image contents to detect exact duplicates
2. When duplicates found, store only ONE copy of the image
3. Store ALL filenames in metadata as an array
4. The multiple filenames provide context hints for LLMs:
   - "forth-interpreter-p1.jpg" + "moore-1130-page1.jpg" -> likely Chuck Moore's Forth
   - Filename patterns may indicate: language, author, page number, deck name

Implementation approach:
```rust
struct ImageMetadata {
    content_hash: String,          // SHA-256 of image bytes
    original_filenames: Vec<String>, // All filenames that map to this image
    primary_filename: String,       // First/canonical filename
    // ... other metadata
}
```

Example:
- User uploads "scan001.jpg" and "page1.tif"
- Both have same content hash
- Store one image, metadata contains both names
- LLM prompt can include: "This image has filenames: scan001.jpg, page1.tif"

TEST DATA DIRECTORY
-------------------
The ./test-data directory is .gitignored and contains actual scans for testing.
This data should be used for:
- Integration testing
- Duplicate detection testing
- LLM classification validation
- End-to-end pipeline testing

Do not commit test-data to git (it's large and may contain sensitive material).
